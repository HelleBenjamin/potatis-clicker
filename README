Potatis Clicker: Remake
=======================

This game is a remake of my original Potatis Clicker, originally released on itch.io. Initially made in C# using Unity(a little overkill) as the engine. This remake is written in C and uses OpenGL as the engine. Aesthetics may seem a little downgrade compared to the original, but it will get better over time.
OpenGL 2.1 is the only minimum requirement. You should be able to run this any computer, even on an old potato(heh a funny joke).

Building
========
On windows:
MinGW is used as the compiler. You need to install GLUT to MinGW's include and lib folder.
For mingw32-make:
1. Run `mingw32-make` at the project directory
2. Run `main.exe`
For CMake:
1. Run `mkdir build` and `cd build`
2. Run `cmake .. -G "MinGW Makefiles"`
3. Run `mingw32-make`
4. Done

On linux:
Dependencies that must be installed:
1. `libglu1-mesa-dev`
2. `freeglut3-dev`
3. `mesa-common-dev`
4. `libglfw3-dev`, If not using the local version

You can use either `make` or `cmake`. CMake is prefered.

For make:
1. Run `make` at the project directory
2. Run `./main`
For CMake:
1. Run `cmake -B build` at the project directory
2. Run `cmake --build build`
3. Run `./build/PotatisClicker`
