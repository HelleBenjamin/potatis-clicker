Potatis Clicker: Remake
=======================

This game is a remake of my original Potatis Clicker, originally released on itch.io. Initially made in C# using Unity(a little overkill) as the engine. This remake is written in C and uses OpenGL as the engine. Aesthetics may seem a little downgrade compared to the original, but it will get better over time.
OpenGL 2.1 is the only minimum requirement. You should be able to run this any computer, even on an old potato(heh a funny joke).

Building
========
On windows:
Windows might need GLUT and GLU headers and other setup. I haven't tested this on Windows yet, so it might be broken.
1. Install MinGW(or an other that you like)
2. Run `mingw32-make` at the project directory
3. Run `main.exe`

On linux:
Dependencies that must be installed:
1. `libglu1-mesa-dev`
2. `freeglut3-dev`
3. `libglfw3-dev`, If not using the local version

You can use either `make` or `cmake`. CMake is prefered.
For make:
1. Run `make` at the project directory
2. Run `./main`
For cmake:
1. Run `cmake -B build` at the project directory
2. Run `cmake --build build`
3. Run `./build/PotatisClicker`
